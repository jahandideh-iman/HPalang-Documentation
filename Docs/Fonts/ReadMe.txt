"IR" series of fonts are "standard" Persian fonts recently published by 
Shora-e-Aali-EttelaRasani. But the official "IR Lotus" font does not 
include a "Bold Iranics" version. So, in LaTeX, having a "Bold Italics" 
text is not possible, and in MS-Word "Bold Italics" Persian texts are 
slanted to right instead of left.

Moreover, the Persian zero (0) character of the standard IRLotus is solid 
(TOO-POR), while it is more beautiful (especially in math formulas) and 
maybe more correct that Persian zero be hollow (TOO-KHAALI).

Therefore, a modified version of "IR Lotus" (called "IRLotusICEE") was 
created for 23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE2015). 

Moreover, I called Shora-e-Aali-e-EttelaRasani on 7 Mehr 1393 to make sure 
that this is not illegal, and I was told that as far as the name of the 
font indicates that this is not created by them, there is no problem.
